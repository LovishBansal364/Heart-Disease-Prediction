# Heart-Disease-Prediction
This project is a machine learning-based web app built with Streamlit to predict the risk of heart disease. It uses a trained KNN model with preprocessing (scaler + feature encoding) to provide predictions based on user inputs like Age, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Heart Rate, ST Slope, Chest Pain Type, and more.
